### Rules  : 

1. Each player takes turn rolling a dice.

2. The rolled dice can then be placed anywhere in the grid, granted it's not already occupied.

3. The player who has the highest score wins!



## Technologies Used: 

### HTML: 

Created the container for the players which has the names of the players, the scores, the dice with it's board and their board where they can place the dice on it.


### CSS:

Styled the HTML to make it more appealing and similiar to the original game. 

### JS:

1. There is Function to roll the dice of each player. 
2. Used the drag and drop function where you can drag the dice to the player's board and drop it. 
3. After that, there is function to create a new dice. 
4. A function to update the players scores. 
5. A function to update the total display score display. 
6. A function to switch players between The Lamb and Flinky. 
7. Is the game over function is to determine if the game is still going on. 
8. Finally get the winner function shows which player hasa the highest score. 


### Favourite function:

My favourite and hated function  at the same time is the Drag and Drop function. It was difficult and challenging to make it work but it looks cool!

The challenging parts were to make it drop to the correct location which was inside each player's board cell. The other problem was when it was dragged, the whole element was dragged and dropped and I needed the value of the dice only. 


### Features to be added later:

1. When the player is placing a double or a tripple in the same color , it will change color.

2. Will add players reaction whenever one of them has a win or a lose. 

3. Add reset button or rematch. 


### Rules to be added later:

1. Placing the same value multiple times in the same column grants increasing score multiplier.

2. Also, placing a dice of the same value in a colmun, removes every opponents dice in the opposing collumn.

3. The game ends if one of the boards is filled but does not determine the winner unless they have a high score.

4. No bonus points are granted for being the one who ends the game.
